# Building the Real World app in React, from scratch

After 6+ years of working professionally in Angular, I'm learning React by rebuilding the [Real World](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) demo app. I'm building from scratch (not cloning the starter repo, Copilot turned off) to maximize learning :).

Current status of app: In progress.

## Tech Stack decisions

My approach is to try to keep libraries rather low-level, to focus on learning fundamentals. At the same time, I'm not using this project to work on skills outside of React (for example, building accessible UI components), so I'm happy to use libraries for those types of functionalities.

- Vite + Typescript - scaffolded from the [Vite React + TypeScript template](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).
- React Router in declarative mode to facilitate overlay modals with their own routes. In a different situation I'd use TanStack Query for a million reasons but I'm trying to engage with React fundamentals here and not using TanStack Query highlights all of the reasons it's super helpful in a way that is useful when learning.
- CSS Modules and Sass for styling. (I actually like writing CSS).

## UX/Design Modifications

The Real World app has a lot of "back of frontend" features to implement, but the user experience [is a bit clunky](https://demo.realworld.build/#/). I'm making some UX and design changes to make it more usable and create better information hierarchy.

### UX

- Sign in and Sign up are now in modal overlays, not separate pages.
- Make it clear what "popular tags" actually do -- clarify that they are interactive with visual cues and a better label ("Show articles about"). Tags are also now multi-select.
- "Show articles about" (fka "popular tags") filters results in place -- no need for a new "feed".
- Logged in user's profile can be almost the same as any other profile -- more consistent UX.
- Add breadcrumbs because some pages (profile, read article) are not represented in the navbar and user has no sense of where they are otherwise.

### Visual Design

- Green color isn't accessible, let's change it to something more accessible.
- Blue color = branding / you can interact with this
- Mint green accent = selected / hovered / active / you can interact (as a background)
